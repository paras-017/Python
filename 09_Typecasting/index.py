# TypeCasting--> is the method to convert the variable data type into a certain data type in order to the operation required to be perform
# "3"+5 is not equal to 7 because 3 is not  a integer so we can't add "3"+5 to solve this we use typeCasting using function INT
a = 5
b = 5
print(a+b)

variable1 = 'paras1'
variable2 = 'paras2'
print(variable1+variable2)


# EXPLICIT TYPECASTING - manual conversion
num1 = int("3")
num2 = int("3")
print(num1+num2)


# IMPLICIT TYPECASTING - automatic conversion
nm1 = 4.5
nm2 = 5   #It wil autmatically convert to float
print(nm1+nm2)
